Some notable things to know about me
======
* Born in 1991, so among the latest batches of Millennials.
* Mom’s a surgeon/gynecologist. Dad’s a retired (yet big-shot) engineer. So yeah, nerds raised me.
* Just got married!! To my best friend, Shafagh. We’ve known each other for 14 years now!! (Awww...)
* Kind of an old soul. Like, I listen to John Denver and Nat King Cole — not to mention Vivaldi.
* Guitar player for, I guess, 20 years — and a huge (and obnoxious) musicophile. My favorite genres are metal, rock, and classical, but good music is beyond any conventional categorization. See? I told you. Obnoxious.
* Fundamentally extroverted. I’d love nothing more than making new friends and having great conversations.
