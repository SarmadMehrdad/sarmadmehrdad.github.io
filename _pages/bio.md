Professional Version (a.k.a. Boring Version):
======
Sarmad Mehrdad received his B.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering from K. N. Toosi University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2015. He earned his M.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering from Clarkson University, Potsdam, NY, in 2019. He is currently completing his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at the New York University Tandon School of Engineering, Brooklyn, NY, under the supervision of [Prof. Ludovic Righetti](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/ludovic-righetti), expected to graduate by December 2025.

His core research focuses on Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) in robotic platforms, ranging from algorithm development to human-motion prediction and analysis. His current research aims to develop online IRL methods for Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), exploiting redundancies in feature and cost spaces to achieve higher computational efficiency, and advancing imitation learning in humanoids.

In addition, he has contributed to several research projects involving the design and deployment of wearable devices, probabilistic modeling, development of AI tools for the diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19, and human bio-signal analysis. During his time at NYU, he also led multiple human-subject data collection studies utilizing EMG, high-density EMG, EEG, and MMG sensors.


Unconventional Version (a.k.a. How I would tell you in person):
======
I got my B.Sc. in MechE back in 2015 from K. N. Toosi University in my hometown, Tehran. I moved to the U.S. in December 2016 to start my M.Sc. in MechE at Clarkson University in upstate New York (Astonishing scenery, lovely people, excruciatingly cold). I wrapped it up in 2019 and started my Ph.D. at NYU in Electrical Engineering in June 2020. I changed my lab after four years (Don’t ask!! It was a turbulent roller-coaster of stories worthy of a book one day!!). I landed in Ludovic’s lab to pursue my current line of research, IRL. Throughout these years, I learned a lot — and not just academically.
<br>I learned how to teach and communicate with a wide range of students, from K-12 to graduate.
<br>I learned how to conduct research and to think critically. (Work in progress; can be better.)
<br>I learned how to navigate 20+ tabs open on my browser.
<br>I learned I have severe ADHD, which explained why I have 20+ tabs open.
<br>I learned how to advise, how to resolve conflict, and how to be patient.
<br>Learned a ton about how advising a student should (and should not) be. In all honesty, if it weren’t for Ludovic, I wouldn’t have seen the “should” side to learn from.

But above all, I think I can say I learned to learn.

From mistakes or job-well-dones, failures or successes, sleepless days or days off. From not knowing why my code doesn’t work — or, for that matter, why it does work!! Everything in my Ph.D. had something to teach me, and looking back, I have changed a lot since the day I started this path.
<br>

I realized in the past decade — despite all my peers advising against it — that my passion lies in becoming a professor one day, and that is what I will pursue to the fullest.
